navclass: Scripts
draft: true

---
In 2020 I decided to do something I've wanted to do for a long time and have a dabble at writing some scripts. I grew up going to the theatre and I love listening to radio drama so it feels a natural place for me to hang out.

My first script was an adaptation of my flash fiction story, EXCHANGE RATE, first published at Ellipsis Zine. This short monologue was performed for me by the wonderful Emma Stansfield (Coronation Street, Jamie Johnson). You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSZz-GFTqDI&t=4s).

My first 10-minute stage play, DATING WITH DOSTOYEVSKY, was one of the winners of [Pint-Sized Plays](https://pintsizedplays.org.uk/) 2020 competition. As Tenby Art Festival is not being held this year, the six winning plays are going to be filmed at put on YouTube, so watch this space!

My second short stage play, SCREEN TEST, was selected by[ Muck and Rumble](https://www.muckandrumble.co.uk/tellingtales) for their 'Telling Tales' event, raising money for Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity. It was directed by [Antony Eden](https://twitter.com/AntonyEdenSays) (The Woman in Black, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) and starred [Julia Hills](https://twitter.com/julia_hills) (Who Dares Wins, 2Point4 Children, Dad).
