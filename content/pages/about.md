My writing career got off to an auspicious start. After a story about a man trying to find his dog, written at the age of seven, at nine I won an award for a poem about my grandpa. I've been attempting to scramble back to those dizzying heights of success ever since.

Despite trying to distract myself with a youth spent running round a track, followed by a science degree, I found the lure of story-telling irresistible. Having accepted a dare to enter an undergraduate novel-writing competition and finding myself shortlisted, I went on to write short stories and then novels. After many terrible sentences and dodgy plotlines, I began to win the occasional prize and, in 2012, my first novel [The Art of Letting Go](/the-art-of-letting-go/) was signed to [The Andrew Lownie Literary Agency](http://www.andrewlownie.co.uk/) by agent [David Haviland](http://www.andrewlownie.co.uk/about_david).

I currently live in a beautiful part of Devon, with [my husband](http://banksco.de), baby son and a sense of childish wonder. When not writing I like to walk on the moor, eat pudding and look at pretty graphs of just about anything. You can keep up with my current news, find a list of my prize-winning stories, and chat about writing and reading on my blog.
