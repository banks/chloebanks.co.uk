Gosh... you want to know more about me? Well OK then, if you insist...

My first literary success was my critically-acclaimed, five-page novel about a man trying to find his dog, written for my eldest sibling's birthday when I was seven. I followed this up two years later by winning an award for a poem I wrote about my Grandpa. After that my career hit the doldrums.

I distracted myself from my crushing failure to be a child prodigy by running round tracks and studying Biological Anthropology at university, where I accepted a dare to enter an undergraduate writing competition. Having made the shortlist for this award, I accidentally forgot to stop writing again. My short and flash fiction have made longlists, shortlists and earned a modest handful of prizes, and my first novel, [_The Art of Letting Go_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Letting-Go-Chloe-Banks-ebook/dp/B00LZRKK9S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525434992&sr=8-1&keywords=the+art+of+letting+go&dpID=41-ZkbL9xbL&preST=_SY445_QL70_&dpSrc=srch), was published by Thistle Publishing in 2014.

I currently live in a beautiful part of Devon, with my husband, two young sons and a sense of childish wonder. When not writing I like to walk on the moor, eat pudding and look at pretty graphs of just about anything. I don't like spiders or celery.

You can have a peek at a few of my stories [here](http://www.ellipsiszine.com/exchange-rate-by-chloe-banks/), [here ](https://theshortstory.co.uk/flash-fiction-blame-a-summary-by-chloe-banks/)and [here](http://www.flash500.com/index_files/finalq16.htm). I am currently working on polishing my novella-in-flash, which was shortlisted (April 2019) in the [Bath Novella-in-Flash Award](https://bathflashfictionaward.com/2019/03/novella-in-flash-2019-award-shortlist-report-by-michael-loveday/) and on writing my first stage scripts.
