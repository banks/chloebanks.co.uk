I'm excited to say that my novel, [_The Art of Letting Go_](https://amzn.to/2Ib8m66), has been selected by Amazon as part of its May Madness promotion. That means you can get the e-book version for Â£0.99.

People have been so kind at supporting me by buying my book and spreading the word over the years. I do appreciate it! Every sale is a great boost to my motivation, and if it leads to a positive review, well... those are literally the things that an author's career is made on!

To read the blurb or some reviews, or just to get straight ahead and dive into reading it, you can find it [here](https://amzn.to/2Ib8m66).
