Each Wednesday I present to you a loveable word and what it means. These are words that look or sound pleasing. This week we are suffering with...

### Malaise.
<!--more-->

This excellent word was suggested to me by [Freya Morris](https://freyajmorris.com/). It can be used to describe a mild physical illness that doesn’t have a known cause or any definite severe symptoms. It can also be used to describe a state of unease within a society (or part of it) which doesn’t seem to have an obvious cure. It might be the ailing economy of a whole country, or the sense of dissatisfaction felt by the workers of one company, for example.  For me, feeling ill is always made slightly more bearable if I am able to tell people my symptoms include “general malaise”. It sounds so beautifully Victorian doesn’t it? Pass the brandy and smelling salts somebody!
