Each Wednesday I present to you a loveable word and what it means. These are words that look or sound pleasing. This week...

### Mellifluous.

<!--more-->

This word was suggested to me by Steve Collingham via Twitter. It’s such a beautiful, fluid word. Pleasingly, it is used to describe a sound that is smooth, pleasant to listen to – almost musical. It has a lovely etymology too, being a 15th-century Latin word meaning “to flow with honey”. Just saying ‘mellifluous’ makes me feel more at ease with the world.
