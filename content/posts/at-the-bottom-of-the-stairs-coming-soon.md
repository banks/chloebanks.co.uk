I am delighted to say that my novella, _At the Bottom of the Stairs_, is going to be published by Reflex Press next year, have been one of the two runners-up in the Reflex Novella Award. 

The award had 173 entries from 18 countries, so I am so pleased to be in the top three. _At the Bottom of the Stairs_ is my second book. As it is seven years (and two children!) since I last had a publishing contract, it's been a long time coming!

Since the award was announced I've been thinking a lot about the evolution of this book. I suppose all books start with a single line, but this is especially true in this case...

About five years ago our family was visiting Cotehele (a National Trust property in Cornwall) and I left my toddler with my husband and went for a walk along the river path to try to get our baby to sleep in the baby carrier. As I walked, some words popped into my head: _tomorrow they will laugh about this_. I often find I get fragments like this, or potential titles etc. but they rarely come to anything. This one though felt different. It was in the future tense and it made me wonder whether I could manage to write a good piece of flash fiction all in the future tense.

Jump forward a few months, and my flash story, _Everything After Now_, won one of the quarterly Flash500 competitions. A lot of people said very kind things about the story, including that they'd like to know what happened to the characters.

Jump forward another 18 months and I'm looking for a writing project. My youngest child is about to start pre-school and I'm finally going to have a few hours a couple of times a week to concentrate on writing. I'd heard about this thing called a 'novella-in-flash' and it sounded ideal. I wanted to write something longer, but had only written flash for a couple of years by this point. The problem was, I didn't have any fresh ideas! Then I remembered _Everything After Now_ and another story that had done well for me, _Wildflower_ and got wondering what it would be like if the main character of those two stories was the same person.

I eventually pulled together a story of about 17 000 words, written in flash fiction chapters and entered it into the Bath Novella-in-Flash Award. I ended up making the top 10 shortlist for that, but I knew this was only really a skeleton of the story I wanted to tell. With the editorial skills and great encouragement from Michael Loveday, the story grew. Not only did it double in length, but in depth too. I found that little events in those original chapters became recurring motifs - tree-climbing, the grief of watching your children grow up, the history of female space-farers.
