I am glad to announce that my short story, _Thad_, has just been published in NEW LIFE: REFLECTIONS FOR LENT (Association of Christian Writers, 2018). 

The book is a collection of writing - devotionals, studies, meditations, stories and poems - each written by a different author, one for every day of Lent. 

My story (the reading for Maundy Thursday) is written from the point of view of one of the lesser-known disciples in the moments following Judas leaving the last supper to betray Jesus. 

You can buy the paperback or get the Kindle version on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Life-Reflections-Amy-Robinson/dp/1999958101/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1518182352&sr=8-1&keywords=association+of+christian+writers).
