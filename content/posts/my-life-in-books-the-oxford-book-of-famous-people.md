*The first post in an occasional series looking at the books on my bookshelves and the bigger story they tell...*

*The Oxford Children’s Book of Famous People* was published in 1994 by the  OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS. My eighth birthday was in October of that year and it must have been given to me as a present <span style="font-size: 1rem;">at about that time. I had lots of books of facts as a child. They were the sort of thi</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">ng I read cover-to-cover, sitting cross-legged on my bed. My desire for knowledge was pretty much insatiable. I eventually gave most of the books away to charity shops, but this one I kep</span><span class="" style="font-size: 1rem;">t, partly as a piece of nostalgia to represent all my World Record and Top Ten books, but also because of the memories that come with it.</span>

My dad worked long hours when I was a kid. He was around at weekends but he was out from breakfast to bedtime during the week, so Monday to Friday I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with him. He would always comes in to say goodnight however, when he got home, and sometimes we would get t<span style="font-size: 1rem;">his book down afterwards&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">and look at it together. I would pick a random page and read out a name from it and Dad would tell me who they were. I’m sure he knew who a lot of them were – my dad’s a smart man – but there were plenty he’d never heard of and these were the ones I liked best of all. If I read a name he didn’t know, he’d make something up – usually something very silly to make me laugh. Thus a German chemist might become a world-famous dry-cleaner, an 18th-century social reformer might be the inventor of some mundane household item, or a 19th-century Austrian politician might be a deep-sea diver.</span>

I love this book because it reminds me of the power of knowledge, the wonder of discovery and the joy of having the whole world stretching out before you as a child. It also inspires me to instil in my boys that same sense of curiosity about the world we live in and the people who populate it.
