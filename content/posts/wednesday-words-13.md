<!--more-->

This was suggested to me by David Hornyak. It’s a beautifully soothing word describing a gentle song used to lull a child to sleep. Indeed, that’s where the word comes from – lull and bye-bye! It has been used for a long time – since the 16th-century. My mum used to sing me a lullaby about Christopher Robin when I was little. I often sang Golden Slumbers to my boys when they were babies. What are your favourite lullabies?
