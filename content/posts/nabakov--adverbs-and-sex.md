I am currently reading the marvellous book, *Nabakov's Favourite Word is Purple*Â by Ben Blatt. In this book Blattt has used statistics to analyse hundreds of novels - from classic literature, to popular modern fiction, to recent prize-winners, to self-published fan fiction. If you are at all interested in The Novel as a form of art, or are fascinated by what makes a novel, I cannot recommend it enough.

I don't want to give too much away because it is a book that deserves to be read, but I thought I'd pull out some snippets as I read to whet your appetite.

The first chapter is on adverbs (by this we mean the adverbs that end in -ly - sleepily, sadly, loudly etc. - not just any word that modifies a verb). Adverbs of this sort have a bad press - budding writers are warned off them, famous writers say all sorts of cutting things about them. So does using fewer adverbs actually make a better novel?

Well, with a few exceptions, the is astonishing evidence that fewer adverbs really are better. Ben Blatt shows analysis after analysis that all point to novels with fewer -ly words being "better". For example, authors who have won big literary prizes tend to use fewer than other authors. Most authors with lots of published novels also show that their books with the fewest adverbs in are their most popular or most critically acclaimed.

The second chapter was on sex/gender. There were so many things that were fascinating here. Is " He interrupted..." or "She interrupted..." more common? Do male authors write "She kissed..." or "He kissed..." most? What about female authors? I'll let you find out those answers for yourself. I'll just end with an interesting little chart showing which words are most strongly associated with a certain gender. (These aren't the most common words to describe women or men, they are the words that are statistically most likely to be used for a certain sex rather than being used equally for either).

**Words most likely to be found as "She..."**

1) Shivered

2) Wept

3) Murmured

4) Screamed

5) Married

**Words most likely to be found as "He..."**

1) Muttered

2) Grinned

3) Shouted

4) Chuckled

5) Killed

So if you find a character getting married while shivering, weeping, murmuring and screaming, she's more likely to be a woman. Whereas a muttering, grinning, shouting, chuckling killer is almost certainly a man.
