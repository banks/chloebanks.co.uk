I have just finished reading *The Road to Little Dribbling*Â which is the 20-year follow-up by Bill Bryson to his fabulous book, *Notes from a Small Island.*

I rather liked this quotation:

"There is something in the pace and scale of British life - an appreciation of small pleasures, a kind of restraint with respect to greed, generally speaking - that makes life strangely agreeable. The British really are the only people in the world who become genuinely enlivened when presented with a hot beverage and a small plain biscuit."

Long may it continue.
