I've made it my mission this year to try submitting my stories for publication in a few of the journals, magazines and zines out there. Although I have had a few pieces published online, they are all a result of entering competitions. I felt it was time to do the very grown-up thing of submitting for publication!

Following the advice of some wonderful writers I submitted my first piece to Ellipsis Zine and was delighted that they accepted it. After a one-word edit (my favourite type of editing), they published it earlier this month. The reception has been really lovely. 

You can find my story, [_Exchange Rate_](http://www.ellipsiszine.com/exchange-rate-by-chloe-banks/), here. I would love to know what you think!
