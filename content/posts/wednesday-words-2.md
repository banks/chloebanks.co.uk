Each Wednesday I present to you a loveable word and what it means. These are words that look or sound pleasing. This week we have...

### **Serendipitous.**<!--more-->



This word was suggested to me by Sarah Smith. It has a pleasing rhythm to it, don’t you think? I think it’s the soft opening followed by the pitter-patter of the last few syllables that makes it so charming.

Serendipitous is an adjective that describes an unexpected or chance event that has a good outcome. A more common synonym might be fortuitous, but serendipitous is by far the superior word in my opinion. Try saying it a few times to yourself, or maybe to the people in the office around you. Pleasing, no?
