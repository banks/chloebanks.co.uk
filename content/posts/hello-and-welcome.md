Welcome to my new blog! If you've followed me across from my old blog (madebythepotter.blogspot.com), thank-you. If you're stumbling across here weary from a journey through cyberspace, you are equally welcome!

If you want to find out more about me then click on the 'About' tab above, or leave a question in the comments. If you're a blogger too then put your blog details in your comment and I'll be sure to pop by and say hello.

Coming soon: photos of books, definitions of obscure words and occasional updates on my progress (or lack thereof).
