Each Wednesday I present to you a loveable word and what it means. These are words that look or sound pleasing. This week I’m choosing one of my own favourite words...

### Megalomaniacal.
<!--more-->

What a silly number of syllables this word has! Once you’ve worked out how to say it (click [here ](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/megalomaniacal)and then click on the speaker symbol next to the word), it trips off the tongue so beautifully. It describes someone who has an excessive lust for power and/or illusions that they are more powerful than they are. Somebody suffering from megalomania as a mental illness may have delusions of grandeur and tend to exaggerate everything about themselves. It is a modern word made by combining megalo- (big, grand) and mania (a wild/violent mental disorder or obsessive interest).
