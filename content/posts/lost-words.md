There was [a rather splendid article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41266000) on the BBC website a few days ago which highlighted a list researchers have drawn up of 30 words that have been lost to the English language.

These words are, without exception, fabulous. I do hope some of them end up making a comeback. Most of them are so wonderfully literal - a *quacksalver* for a fake doctor, *tremblable* for something that fills you with fear. My favourite two are probably:

*Merry-go-sorry* - a way of describing being both joyful and sorrowful at once.

*Ear-rent* - the figurative cost of spending time listening to pointless talk.

Do join me in bringing these back into everyday conversation!
