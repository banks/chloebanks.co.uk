Happy New Year! This year has been a quiet year of writing for me, although not entirely without success. Three pieces of flash fiction came [third in Flash 500](https://chloebanks.co.uk/posts/third-place---flash-500/), third in the [Ruth Rendell Short Story Prize](https://chloebanks.co.uk/posts/third-prize---ruth-rendell-short-story-competition/) (for which I went to a prize-ceremony in London to hear my story read by an actor!) and [highly commended ](https://chloebanks.co.uk/posts/tss-flash-400---highly-commended/)in the TSS Flash Fiction Competition.

I have spent the last five months or so doing something I hadn't planned at all. I have written a novella-in-flash! I don't think I even knew what that was a year ago! It has been so much fun to write and I'm moderately pleased with the draft so that has been a surprise bonus of my year. Even if nothing comes of it, it has caused me to write 18 new stories - not something I imagined was possible 12 months ago.

And so, to reading. I have read 26 books this year, and listened to a few more. Some of the books were flash fiction or non-fiction, but most were novels. Here is my 2018 novel-reading list ranked in order from my favourite:

 1. The End We Start From - Megan Hunter
 2. One - Sarah Crossan
 3. Gentlemen and Players - Joanne Harris
 4. The Muse - Jessie Burton
 5. The Millstone - Margaret Drabble
 6. Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine - Gail Honeyman
 7. Larry's Party - Carol Shields
 8. The Last Battle - CS Lewis
 9. The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle - Stuart Turton
10. Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit - Jeanette Winterson
11. Midwinter Break - Bernard MacLaverty
12. Snobs - Julian Fellowes
13. Blue-Eyed Boy - Joanne Harris
14. Friend Request - Laura Marshall
15. Breakdown - BA Paris
16. The Housekeeper - Suellen Dainty
17. The Beach Wedding - Dorothy Koomson
18. The Girl Next Door - Ruth Rendell

The first four on this list all scored 10/10 from me - really recommend them all, although they are all very different! Because I loved _Gentlemen and Players_ and the other book in the trilogy, _Different Class_ (read last year), I was disappointed not to enjoy _Blue-Eyed Boy_ nearly as much. Not as disappointed as I was with _The Girl Next Door_, however. I've enjoyed some Ruth Rendell on the radio, but this was the first time I tried to read one of her books and I didn't think much of it at all. Somebody recommend me one of hers that is good please, as I'd love to try again!

Of my non-novel list of books, my favourites were _I Am, I Am, I Am_ by Maggie O'Farrell, and _This is Going to Hurt_ by Adam. Kay. 10/10 for both of those. I also recommend, _How to Make a Window Snake_ (a collection of novellas-in-flash), _The Good Women of China_ by Xinran, and the flash fiction collection from Freya Morris, _This is (not about) David Bowie_. I also read:

* Out of the Woods - Will Cohu
* Raising Boys - Steven Biddulph 
* My Very End of the Universe (novellas-in-flash collection)
* The Diary of a Bookseller - Shaun Bythell

What did you read in 2018? Anything I should read in 2019?

May 2019 bring you happiness, good books, and all the right words in all the right order.
