Time for the end-of-year round up of all the books I've listened to and read in 2020. There are 48 of them - 19 audiobooks and 29 paper/e-books - plus I listened to some short stories, and both listened to and read a lot of stage plays. (I'm also listening to and reading excellent books at the moment!) This was definitely the year when I got back into the joy of audiobooks when doing mundane household tasks!

I'm not going to list them all this year. Instead, I'm going to list only the ones I gave 9/10 or 10/10 for enjoyment in my book diary...

 1. Nabakov’s Favourite Word is Mauve – Ben Blatt
 2.  The Familiars – Stacey Halls
 3. The Secret History – Donna Tartt
 4. The Body – Bill Bryson
 5. Gotta Get Theroux This – Louis Theroux
 6. Sweet Sorrow - David Nicholls
 7. The Hunting Party - Lucy Foley
 8. Wolf Hall / Bring Up the Bodies / The Mirror and the Light - Hilary Mantel
 9. The Most Fun We've Ever Had - Claire Lombardo
10. How Not to Be a Boy - Robert Webb
11. The Guest List - Lucy Foley
12. There Are Things That I Know - Karen B Golightly
13. Anne of Green Gables - LM Montgomery
14. Miss Benson's Beetle - Rachel Joyce
15. The Understudy - David Nicholls

There we are - four non-fiction, one novella, one children's book and 11 novels.

I was going to pick a Book of the Year, but I'm struggling to narrow it down. Having put off Hilary Mantel's trilogy for years, I was blown away by how amazing it was. The Familiars was one of the best audio books I've ever listened to, and Miss Benson's Beetle was such a joy. I'm now a huge Lucy Foley fan too. Both she and Ruth Ware write stories that have all my favourite elements of cosy crime/ golden age murder mysteries, but are modern and original and the writing style is great. If you are an Agatha Christie fan, but maybe find her writing style a little off-putting, I massively recommend these.

What books have you loved this year?
