Each Wednesday I present to you a loveable word and what it means. These are words that look or sound pleasing. This week I give you...

### **Dirigible.**

This pleasingly bubbly word was suggested by Steph Wetherell. It is an adjective used to describe something that is easily directed or steered. <!--more-->

 It is also a noun, meaning a type of airship. I am reliably informed by

<a href="http://the-urban-cottage.blogspot.co.uk/">Jenny Hickson</a> that Harry Potter fans will recognise the word from the ‘dirigible plums’ loved by the Lovegood family. These plums float above their plant like mini-airships and are claimed by some in the wizarding world to enhance the ability of somebody to accept extraordinary things – i.e. to steer their thoughts towards the extraordinary. So now you know. In our Muggle world it is word from the late 16th-century, coming from the Latin dirigere (to direct).
