Happy World Book Day, friends! I thought it would be fun to recommend a few books that I've loved reading. When deciding which ones to select I hit on two criteria:

1. They have to be books physically on the shelves of my house now (which means I've skipped a lot of books I've borrowed or read on Kindle or given away).
2. They need to be from a broad range of genres.

So these aren't necessarily my top books of all time, but here are 10 books I randomly plucked off my shelves this morning as ones I enjoyed!

1 - _The Stand_, by Stephen King. Epic, apocalyptic and not at all your classic horror story. Read this if you like: _1984_ by George Orwell.

2 - _I Capture the Castle_ by Dodie Smith. A beautiful 1930s coming-of-age tale, but not just for kids and teens. Read this if you'd like a more grown-up version of _The Secret Garden_ by Frances Hodgson Burnett.

3 - _Closed Casket_ by Sophie Hannah. The second of the new Hercule Poirot books commissioned by the Agatha Christie estate. All the charm of a classic cosy crime with less-dated writing. Read this if you'd like books by Agatha Christie without the exasperation.

4 - _Crime and Punishment_  by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. A fascinating and intense look into the aftermath of a crime. More captivating than any other Russian literature I've read. Read this if you'd like _Enderby_ by Sebastian Faulkes with more angst and set in Russia.

5 - _We Need to Talk About Kevin_ by Lionel Shriver. Chilling, unforgettable, twisted, deeply personal. Read this if you'd like a slower-burning, more unsettling _Gone Girl_ by Gillian Flynn.

6 - _The Eyre Affair_ by Jasper Fforde. Brilliant and funny and smart. In a genre all of it's own - quirky magical realism without the magic?! A must-read for people who love literature and want to laugh. Read this if you'd like Tom Holt books without the magic and plentiful in-jokes about other books.

7 - _Oh The Places You'll Go_ by Dr. Seuss. The master storyteller at his finest, quirkiest and most inspirational. Should be compulsory reading in all schools. Read this if you'd like _Winnie-the-Pooh_ by AA Milne crossed with _The Cat in the Hat_.

8 - _I See You_ by Claire Mackintosh. One of the better reads in the booming psychological thriller genre. Clever idea. Twisty. Read this if you'd like _The Girl on the Train_ by Paula Hawkins with more insight into the police side of things.

9 - _The Life and Loves of a She Devil_ by Faye Weldon. Bitter and brilliant. A modern fable. Feminist, funny and sharp. Read this if you'd like Jane Austen writing in the 20th-century while slightly tipsy.

10 - _The Weight of Glory_ by CS Lewis. A collection of his finest essays and sermons. The title piece is particularly fine. Read this if you'd like some theology that is deep, to the point and in bite-sized chunks.

So there you go... apocalyptic fiction, coming-of-age tales, cosy crime, classic Russian literature, twisted page-turners, quirky humour, inspirational children's books, psychological thrillers, razor sharp fables and deep theology. And if none of those take your fancy then you can of course read my novel instead! Art, artifice and madness - _The Art of Letting Go_.
