Happy World Book Day, friends! I thought it would be fun to recommend a few books that I've loved reading. When deciding which ones to select I hit on two criteria:

1. They have to be books physically on the shelves of my house now (which means I've skipped a lot of books I've borrowed or read on Kindle or given away).
2. They need to be from a broad range of genres.

So these aren't necessarily my top books of all time, but here are 12 books I think you might like...

1 - _The Stand_, by Stephen King. Epic, apocalyptic and not at all your classic horror story. Read this if you like: _1984_ by George Orwell.

2 - _I Capture the Castle_ by Dodie Smith. A beautiful 1930s coming-of-age tale, but not just for kids and teens. Read this if you like: _The Secret Garden_ by Frances Hodgson Burnett.

3 - _Closed Casket_ by Sophie Hannah. The second of the new Hercule Poirot books commissioned by the Agatha Christie estate. All the charm of a classic cosy crime with less-dated writing. Read this if you like: books by Agatha Christie!

4 - _Crime and Punishment_  by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. A fascinating and intense look into the aftermath of a crime. More captivating than any other Russian literature I've read. Read this if you like: _Enderby_ by Sebastian Faulkes.

5 - _We Need to Talk About Kevin_ by Lionel Shriver. Chilling, unforgettable, twisted, deeply personal. Read this if you like: _Gone Girl_ by Gillian Flynn.

6 - _The Eyre Affair_ by Jasper Fforde. Brilliant and funny and smart. In a genre all of it's own - quirky magical realism without the magic?! A must-read for people who love literature and want to laugh. Read this if you like: Hmmmm... Tom Holt books maybe? Or just if you are human.

7 - _Oh The Places You'll Go_ by Dr. Seuss. The master storyteller at his finest, quirkiest and most inspirational. Should be compulsory reading in all schools. Read this if you'd like: _Winnie-the-Pooh_ crossed with _The Cat in the Hat_.

8 - _I See You_ by Claire Mackintosh. One of the better reads in the booming psychological thriller genre. Clever idea. Twisty. Read this if you like: _The Girl on the Train_.

9 - _The Life and Loves of a She Devil_ by Faye Weldon. Bitter and brilliant. A modern fable. Feminist, funny and sharp. Read this if you'd like: Jane Austen writing in the 20th-century while slightly tipsy.

10 - _The Weight of Glory_ by CS Lewis. A collection of his finest essays and sermons. The title piece is particularly fine. Read this if you like: _Mere Christianity_.

11 - _Room_ by Emma Donoghue. A well-deserved shortlistee for the Booker. Clasuterphobic, chilling but somehow hopeful. Narrated perfectly by a young child. Read this if you like:
