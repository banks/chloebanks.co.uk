I may not have done much writing this year, but I have done some reading. Hooray! Still not as much reading as I'd like, but I've read some crackers. Here are the 21 books I've read this year:

* THE MOTHERS (Brit Bennett). I could tell this came out of a creative writing MFA. Literary and beautiful. A slow burner but I came to love it. 9/10
* DIFFERENT CLASS (Joanne Harris). Loved this. Even though I knew there was "misdirection" involved, I didn't guess where it came and it was absolutely masterful in its construction. This is the second novel in a series, which I didn't realise until afterwards - and I still loved it. 10/10
* THE LONEY (Andrew Michael Hurley). Another literary one. Stunning writing (winner of the Costa Book Award), but I felt I was missing something. It didn't grab me. Worth reading for the stark beauty of the writing. 7/10
* THE ROAD TO LITTLE DRIBBLING (Bill Bryson). I was so disappointed in this! NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND was one of my favourite books as a teenager and this is the 20-year follow-up. It had so many funny lines and tonnes of interesting facts that rescued it, but the bottom line is that it was too grumpy. Bryson moved from sharp and a little snide to seeming mean-spirited and entitled. Much to like but the joy was taken away for me. 7/10
* PUBLIC LIBRARY (Ali Smith). A mix of short stories and discussions with people about libraries. I felt as if I wasn't sophisticated enough to get this book. It made me think I might like one of Ali Smith's novels but the only thing I enjoyed a lot here was the quality of the writing, not its contents. 6/10
