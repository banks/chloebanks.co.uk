Each Wednesday I present to you a loveable word and what it means. These are words that look or sound pleasing. This week I bring to you...


### Onomatopoeia.
<!--more-->




Jim Newton-Smith (among others!) suggested this word to me. It is a famously hard-to-spell descriptor, meaning words that imitate the sound of what they are trying to describe. “**BANG**!” for example, or “**fizz**”. It comes froma  Greek compound word meaning "name-making" or "word-making", via Latin into our 16th-century vocabulary.

When  I asked people to suggest loveable words to me, not only did several people mention “onomatopoeia”, but many others suggested words that were themselves onomatopoetic. Lauren Francis, for example, suggested **slosh**, **plink **and **whoosh**, all of which are excellent and lovely. I am personally quite partial to **splat**.
