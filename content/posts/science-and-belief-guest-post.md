Today, I have [a guest article](https://scienceandbelief.org/2017/09/14/guest-post-a-hominin-by-any-other-name-would-be-just-as-wise/) posted on the Science and Belief blog run by Dr. Ruth Bancewicz of the Faraday Institute. I always think it is a compliment to be asked to write for anybody a second time!

It's refreshing to be asked to write non-fiction occasionally. As you read the post, you can imagine me putting on my glasses and looking very academic and intelligent as I went back to my roots as an evolutionary biologist, coupled it up with my faith as a Christian, and wrote about how to go about naming new species of extinct human and what it all means for man being made in the image of God.
