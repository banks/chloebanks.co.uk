I'm pleased to be able to say that my piece of flash fiction, _Words_, has won third prize in Flash 500 (4th Quarter, 2017).

Last year I ran a series of posts about favourite words. The suggestions people gave me for their favourite words gave me the idea for this story. I initially wrote in int he middle of the year, but I couldn't get the ending to work. Then, at the end of December I had another go. I still feel it didn't quite work out how I wanted it to but I also felt that a) I wasn't quite sure how I _did_ want it to work, and b) I probably wasn't going to spend any more time on it anyway. Reasonably pleased with it, I sent it off to Flash 500. 

I would have been disappointed if I hadn't made the longlist, but I felt that making the shortlist was probably a bit of a stretch. Therefore I was more than happy to find out I had not only been shortlisted, but actually won third prize!
