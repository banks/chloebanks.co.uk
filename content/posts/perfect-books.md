For the last eight years I have been keeping a reading diary of all the books I read or listen to. I give each book a mark out of 10 - not for how good they are, but for how much I enjoy them. Some books may be brilliant from a literary point of view, but I don't actually enjoy reading them. Other books definitely leave a little to be desired stylistically but I had a grand time immersed in them. Obviously the quality of the writing does have a big effect on my enjoyment anyway!

I thought it would be fun to do a little round-up of all the books - 35 of them - which I gave a full 10 out of 10 to when I first read them. I'm pretty easily pleased - there were also dozens of books which scored eight or nine! These books are both brilliant and entertaining. Here they are in the order in which I read them (square brackets indicate an audiobook):

_Cold Comfort Farm_ – Stella Gibbons

_The Blind Assassin_ – Margaret Atwood

_Room_ – Emma Donoghue

_One Day_ – David Nicholls

_Gone Girl_ – Gillian Flynn

_The Remains of the Day_ – Kazuo Ishiguro

_The Eyre Affair_ – Jasper Fforde

_The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry_ – Rachel Joyce

_The Shock of the Fall_ - Nathan Filer

_Perfect_ - Rachel Joyce

_We Are All Completely Besides Ourselves_ - Joy Fowler

_The Miniaturist_ – Jessie Burton

_The Book Thief_ - Marcus Zusak

_The Time Traveller’s Wife_ – Audrey Niffenegger

_The Moth_ – Various

_Never Let Me Go_ - Kazuo Ishiguro

_I See You_ – Claire Mackintosh

_Different Class_ – Joanne Harris

_The Life and Loves of a She Devil_ – Fay Weldon

\[_Big Little Lies_ – Liane Moriarty\]

_Gentlemen and Players_ - Joanne Harris

_The End We Start From_ – Megan Hunter

_The Muse_ – Jessie Burton

_I Am, I Am, I Am_ – Maggie O’Farrell

_This is Going to Hurt_ – Adam Kay

_One_ – Sarah Crossan

_Our Endless Numbered Days_ – Claire Fuller

_Bottled Goods_ Sophie van Llewyn

_The Poisonwood Bible_ – Barbara Kingsolver

_Us_ – David Nicholls

\[_The Familiars_ – Stacey Hall\]

\[_The Body_ - Bill Bryson\]

_Sweet Sorrow –_ David Nicholls

\[_The Hunting Party_ – Lucy Foley\]

\[_The Wolf Hall Trilogy_ – Hilary Mantel\]

I was thinking of trying to rank them in order, but figured that would be too hard. The authors that have more than one book here - Kazuo Ishiguro, Rachel Joyce, Jessie Burton and David Nicholls - all have a similar feel to them. They are authors of quietly devastating, beautifully underwritten books of real, flawed people. They don't always have happy, neat endings, but they are also not at all bleak.

There is something for everyone in this list, I think: comedy (_The Eyre Affair_), science fiction (_Never Let Me Go_), crime (_I See You_), thrillers (_The Hunting Party_), twists and turns (_Gone Girl_), astonishing mind-bending concepts (_The Time-Traveller's Wife_), memoir (_I Am, I Am, I Am_), novella (_Bottled Goods_), non-fiction (_The Body_), whole novels in blank verse (_One_), and a surprising amount of historical fiction from someone who doesn't really count themselves as a big historical fiction reader (_Wolf Hall, The Miniaturist_ etc.) 

If I was off to my Desert Island and could only pack five of these to re-read forever, which would I take? It's tricky! I think I would definitely take _The Remains of the Day, One Day_ and _I Am, I Am, I Am_. Then I would be very torn - my narrowing down only got me as far as another 11 candidates! I'm tempted by _The Wolf Hall Trilogy_ as that is actually three books and was the most recent one to absolutely blow me away with how captivating it is, and then _Cold Comfort Farm_ to make me laugh. But I am leaving behind _Harold Fry, The Time Traveller's Wife_ and _The Poisonwood Bible_ in particular with great regret!

And when that tidal wave comes and I can only rescue one? That's less hard. I don't think I could ever bear to see _The Remains of the Day_ destroyed.

How about you? Which books score a Perfect 10 from you?
