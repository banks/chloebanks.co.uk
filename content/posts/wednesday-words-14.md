Each Wednesday I present to you a loveable word and what it means. These are words that look or sound pleasing. This week I give you...

### Telemetry.

<!--more-->

Fellow-writer, Derek Thompson suggested this word to me. As a scientist, I am pleased to have a good technical word in our loveable list. Telemetry is the recording of data with scientific instruments which is then transmitted over distance by, for example, radio waves. It is also the science of measuring linear distance using something called a tellurometer. It is obviously a modern word, but it comes from tele- (far-off, distant) and â€“metry (measurer).
