Excited to be able to tell my antipodean friends that *The Art of Letting Go* is currently on offer in the Australian Kindle store. For the rest of the month you can get my debut novel for only $1.49. Mr. Google tells me that is about 88p in British money which is surely a bargain for a book that has been nominated for an award, been in the Kindle Top 50 and has an average review rating of over 4 stars? Please do spread the word to all your Australian friends!
