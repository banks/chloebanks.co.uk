My highly-commended flash story, _Blame: A Summary_, has been published by the competition organisers [TSS Publishing](https://www.theshortstory.co.uk/).

It is available to read online for free [here](https://www.theshortstory.co.uk/flash-fiction-blame-a-summary-by-chloe-banks/). 

If you read my previous post you will know this was a highly experimental piece for me. I had never written about an "issue" before, and the style was unlike any of my other work. I was delighted therefore, to be Highly Commended, and even more so to be published. I hope you enjoy it!
